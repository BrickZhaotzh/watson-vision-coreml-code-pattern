This Code Pattern was created for developers who want to create intelligent mobile apps powered with IBM Watson for the Apple mobile platform.

It requires some skills on Swift but if you have background on other programming languages, the code is still simple and fairly straightforward.

Make sure that you have installed Xcode 9 or later and iOS 11.0 or later.

You will also need to [install Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage).

**These versions are required to support Core ML.**
