This Code Pattern was created for developers who want to create intelligent mobile apps powered with IBM Watson for the Apple mobile platform.

It requires some familiarity with Swift, but if you have a background in any other programming languages, the code is very simple and fairly straightforward.

Make sure that you have the latest version of Xcode installed and a device running iOS 11.0 or later.

**These versions are required to support Core ML.**
